# Upgrading from 1.1

> **Draft.** This guide is filled as 2.0 lands. The steps and the mapping below are the plan ([decisions/0003](decisions/0003-evolve-in-place.md)); the commands they mention don't exist yet.

2.0 keeps the 1.x class names and their protected API. What it replaces is deprecated until 3.0, so a site can upgrade first and clean up its code afterwards. Sites usually upgrade when they move to Panneau 5, since the Panneau plugin ships with 2.0.

## Before you start

- The site runs **PHP 8.3+ and Laravel 12+** ([decisions/0001](decisions/0001-supported-versions.md)). Upgrade Laravel first if needed.
- The site requires a tagged 1.1 release (`^1.1`), not `v1.1.x-dev`, and is on the latest one.
- The site moves to `laravel-mediatheque` 2, `laravel-image` 2 and Panneau 5 if it uses the matching modules. Their own upgrade guides come first.
- Back up the database.

## Steps

1. **Require the new version:** `composer require folklore/laravel-folklore:^2.0`, and the packages of the modules the site uses (they are suggested, no longer required).
2. **Check the site:** `php artisan folklore:upgrade --check`. It lists the modules the site uses, removed modules it still uses, block data to convert, JSON reference keys that aren't mapped, and deprecated macros.
3. **Upgrade:** `php artisan folklore:upgrade`. It enables the site's modules in `config/site.php`, sets the media reference key that the site writes (`medias://`), and converts block data.
4. **Run the Rector rules.**
5. **Run the site's tests**, and check pages, forms with media, and logins.
6. **Fix the deprecations** at your own pace. They are logged on the `deprecations` channel.
7. **Later:** move media references to `media://` with `php artisan folklore:json-references:rewrite --from=medias --to=media`, once front ends read both.

## What changes

### Dependencies and modules

| 1.1 | 2.0 |
|---|---|
| Requires the mediatheque, `laravel-image`, Panneau 1.x, Fortify, Guzzle, `google/apiclient`, `parsecsv` | Requires `illuminate/*`; the rest is suggested per module |
| Everything boots | Modules boot when enabled in `config/site.php` |
| `repository` auth provider and Fortify callbacks always registered | Auth module |
| The mediatheque's model contracts rebound by the package | `config('mediatheque.models')` |
| Global paginator page resolver override | Removed: `OffsetPaginator` resolves its own offset |
| Site manager, organisations, PubSubHubbub | Removed |

### API

| 1.1 | 2.0 | Until 3.0 |
|---|---|---|
| `Entity extends Panneau\Contracts\ResourceItem` | `Entity` on its own | — (breaking) |
| `Entities extends Panneau\Contracts\Repository` | `Entities` on its own | — (breaking) |
| `get($params, $page, $count)` | Typed query | Kept |
| `setGlobalQuery()` | `withGlobalQuery()`, default resolver | Kept |
| `$jsonAttributeName` | `$jsonAttributes` | Kept, deprecated |
| `JsonDataCast::macro(...)`, `get`/`set`/`before_set` options | Reference handlers | Kept, deprecated |
| `lazy` | `withJsonReferences()` | Kept, deprecated |
| Panneau 1.x fields and resources | Panneau 5 plugin | Removed |
| `blocks_pivot` | Blocks in the page's JSON | Converted by `folklore:upgrade` |

### JSON data

Stored references don't change. Without `JsonData::enforceMap()`, a key that isn't mapped falls back to the relation of the same name, as in 1.x. See [json-data.md](json-data.md#from-1x).
